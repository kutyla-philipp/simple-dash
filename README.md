# Homepage

This project is a simple, standalone, self-hosted PHP page that is meant to be your window to your server and the web. 

It is your minimalist corner of the internet. The background will update with a gorgeous (and royalty free) image from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/), or a custom source every 20 seconds. With it, a simple menu is available to you with your most frequented links. 

All the assets needed are part of the repo so it can run offline (though it won't fetch pretty background images for you). 

This project uses:
- jQuery
- Bootstrap CSS
- Mousetrap.js
- Font Awesome
- Unsplash

## To Use
Copy the config.sample.json file and rename to config.json. Be sure to update the fields as you see appropriate. You have the option to use the Unsplash API to fetch background images, or use a custom URL and JSON selector. If you choose to use Unsplash, will need to create a developer profile at [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) to use the background image functionality properly. 

## Configure Homepage
- 'unlock_pattern' => Choose unlock pattern from [Mousetrap](https://craig.is/killing/mice)
- 'clock_format' => Choose pattern format from [PHP's date function](http://php.net/manual/en/function.date.php)
- 'items' => The menu will be in a grid of 3 icons per row on desktop. Insert any link you'd like, or {{cur}} for the current URL of the page. Choose icons from [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/icons/)

### Unsplash Background Images
- 'unsplash_client_id' => Get Unsplash client ID from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/developers)

### Custom Background Images
- 'custom_url' => Input a custom URL that will return proper JSON
- 'custom_url_headers' => Add any headers that may be needed to complete a cURL request to the aforementioned URL properly
- 'custom_url_selector' => Input a proper PHP array selector to be used on the JSON received above. For example, if I were to fetch from Github's user API with a 'custom_url' of 'https://api.github.com/users/octocat', the 'custom_url_selector' would simply be "['avatar_url']". [{random}] can be replaced for a random index in an array.
